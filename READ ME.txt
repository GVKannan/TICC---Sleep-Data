Hi!
Few important information to be noted while running our code:
* David Hallac and co has written the code for Linux/Ubuntu hence you need to add the following to the code while executing TICC in Windows:
"if __name__ == '__main__':"

* We made few adjustment to the orginal code so that we could work on it - TICC_solver.py

try:
                val = optRes[cluster].get()
            except np.linalg.LinAlgError:
                print("Linear Algebra Error Raised! Moving to next iteration")
                time.sleep(2)
                continue

The reason why we had to do was because sometimes the data calculation doesn't converge to find solutions hence we skip that iteration and move ahead.

* Finally, in the fit() function in TICC_solver.py, the return function also returns the bic value after fitting for experimental purpose.
